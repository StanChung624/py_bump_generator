# ‚öôÔ∏è Virtual Bump Generator

**Virtual Bump Generator** is a Python toolkit designed to create and manage virtual solder bumps (v-bumps). It provides both a terminal-based CLI and a PySide6 GUI, supporting CSV, HDF5, and Moldex3D WDL formats. Whether you‚Äôre batch-generating rectangular arrays, adjusting group properties, or visually inspecting substrate regions, everything can be done efficiently.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Dual Interface**:  
  - `python main.py` ‚Äî interactive CLI.  
  - `python main_ui.py` ‚Äî GUI with 3D plotting.  
- **Multi-format Support**: Import/export CSV, HDF5 (`.h5/.vbump`), and Moldex3D WDL (weldline/airtrap).  
- **Large Dataset Handling**: Stream-writing HDF5 support for efficiently managing hundreds of thousands of v-bumps.  
- **Group Operations**: Adjust diameter, move/copy by group, convert to WDL, and automatically maintain bounding boxes.  
- **Visualization Tools**: Built-in matplotlib 3D plotting and substrate detection for quick layout verification.  

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `main.py`: Interactive CLI entry point.  
- `main_ui.py`: PySide6 GUI entry point.  
- `VBumpDef.py`: Defines `VBump` data class, handles CSV/HDF5 I/O, and computes bounding boxes.  
- `createRectangularArea.py`: Generates rectangular arrays and provides HDF5 streaming utilities.  
- `vbumpsManipulation.py`: Diameter adjustment, move/copy operations, etc.  
- `fileManipulation.py`: Merges multiple CSV files.  
- `vbumps2WDL.py`: Exports Moldex3D WDL, computes AABB, and provides plotting utilities.  
- `requirements.txt`: Dependency list.  
- `install.md`: Example PyInstaller packaging instructions.  
- `model_Run1.h5`, `model_Run1.vbump`: Example datasets.  

## üß© Installation & Environment
Use **Python 3.10 or above** and create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # For Windows use .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you only need the CLI, you may skip installing PySide6-related packages; however, keeping all dependencies is recommended for easy mode switching.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Workflow
```bash
python main.py
```
Main menu options:
1. `Load VBump CSV`: Load a CSV (overwrite or append) and optionally reset group IDs.  
2. `Save VBump CSV`: Export the current v-bump list.  
3. `Create rectangular area (pitch)`: Generate rectangular array using pitch parameters.  
4. `Create rectangular area (count)`: Specify X/Y counts and auto-distribute evenly.  
5. `Modify diameter`: Adjust diameters globally or by group.  
6. `Move/Copy vbumps`: Move or copy using reference points, with optional new diameter/group.  
7. `Export to WDL (weldline)`: Export Moldex3D Weldline WDL; for ‚â•300,000 entries, auto-switch to per-group AABB output.  
8. `Export to WDL (airtrap)`: Export Airtrap WDL using midpoints.  
9. `Merge CSV files`: Merge multiple CSVs and optionally auto-load.  
10. `Plot vbumps AABB`: Visualize group bounding boxes using matplotlib (with substrate overlay).  
11. `Set substrate box corners`: Define substrate bounding coordinates.  
0. `Exit`: Quit the program.  

### ü™ü GUI Workflow
```bash
python main_ui.py
```
GUI features:
- Load/Save dialogs for CSV, HDF5, and VBUMP.  
- Wizard-style flow for creating rectangular arrays by Pitch or Count.  
- Tools for diameter adjustment, move/copy, group deletion, etc.  
- One-click export for Weldline/Airtrap WDL.  
- 3D Plot window with Top/Front/Right/Default view buttons.  
- Real-time log window displaying all actions.  

If the GUI fails to launch, ensure PySide6 and matplotlib are installed. On macOS, verify Qt dependencies are available.

## üìÑ Data Format
- **CSV** uses UTF-8 encoding by default:
  ```
  # Virtual Bump Configuration file. Unit:mm
  # x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, diameter, group
  ```
- **HDF5 (`to_hdf5`)** creates a dataset named `vbump` with fields in the same order as CSV.  
  It stores global and per-group bounding boxes as dataset attributes for quick indexing.  

## üìä Plotting & Visualization
- The CLI pauses during plot display; close the plot window to resume.  
- The GUI plot is interactive (mouse & view buttons). Setting a substrate box clarifies bump‚Äìsubstrate height relationships.  

## üß± Moldex3D WDL Export
- `vbumps2WDL.py` updates `ItemTypeInfo`, `NodeInfo`, and related sections to ensure correct Weldline/Airtrap WDL import into Moldex3D.  
- For large v-bump datasets, the tool automatically outputs per-group AABB wireframes to reduce node count.  

## üì¶ Packaging as Executable
See example in `install.md`:
```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name "VBumpGenerator" --icon "icon.ico" main_ui.py
```
For a CLI-only version, use `main.py` as the entry point and remove `--noconsole` if desired.

## üß† Troubleshooting
- **ImportError: No module named PySide6** ‚Üí Missing GUI dependencies. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
- **Matplotlib backend error** ‚Üí Use CLI mode or non-interactive backend (Agg) in headless environments.  
- **HDF5 errors** ‚Üí Ensure `h5py` and `numpy` are installed, and that HDF5 libraries are available.  
- **CSV garbled text** ‚Üí Read with UTF-8 encoding.  

## ü§ù Contribution & License
Contributions via Issues/PRs are welcome. Before submitting:
- Run `python main.py` and `python main_ui.py` for smoke testing.  
- Verify CSV/HDF5/WDL import/export works as expected.
